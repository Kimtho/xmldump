XMLDump for Umbraco
===================

If you’ve been developing XSLT for Umbraco, you’ve probably already done your share
of `<textarea><xsl:copy-of select="." /></textarea>` to examine the XML you’re transforming...
let’s get rid of that habit and do something much better.

With this simple package (it’s just an XSLT macro) you’ll have instant access to all
published nodes, selectable by id or nodeTypeAlias - many browsers support viewing XML
in a nice color-coded fashion, so now you can let IE6 do the only thing it’s good at and
leave it open on your secondary screen :-)

Revision History
