XMLDump for Umbraco

If you’ve been developing XSLT for Umbraco, you’ve probably already done your share of <textarea><xsl:copy-of select="." /></textarea> to examine the XML you’re transforming... let’s get rid of that habit and do something much better.

With this simple package (really, it’s just an XSLT macro and the accompanying DocumentType & Template to get it going), you’ll have instant access to all published nodes, selectable by id or nodeTypeAlias - many browsers support viewing XML in a nice color-coded fashion, so now you can let IE6 do the only thing it’s good at and leave it open on your secondary screen :-)
